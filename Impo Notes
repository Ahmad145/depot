Note1:
In app/views/depot/app/views/line_items/create.js.erb, following line was written:
page.replace_html('cart' , render(@cart)) 
In book above line was written, but this line was causing an error of template missing so, I added the above line with the help of Ahmad Bhai and Ibraheem and replaced with the below line! Happy Coding :)
$('#cart').html("<%= escape_javascript render(@cart) %>");


Note2:
11.3 functionality, high light functionality could not implemented!!! :(


Note3:
11.4 functionality, is added but not with the help of js
implemented using this: <% unless cart.line_items.empty? %>
Instead of: page[:cart].visual_effect :blind_down if @cart.total_items == 1
